Description:
At the moment this Submission contains almost all of the Must requirements except for Listing guests within event and Displaying the details of a customer with event information.

I struggled initially with a migration issue where an extra migration was in the migrations folder and causing incorrect variable names to try assigning within my Catering API.
To solve this I simply deleted the migration that was causing the issue and it fully migrated to the SQL database.
